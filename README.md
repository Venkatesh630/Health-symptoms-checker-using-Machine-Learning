# Health-symptoms-checker-using-Machine-Learning
The goal is to develop a machine learning-based system that accurately predicts potential  medical conditions based on a user's symptoms. Users input their symptoms, and the system  suggests possible diagnoses, recommends further actions (e.g., visiting a doctor), or provides  health advice. The system must provide reliable, interpretable results.
